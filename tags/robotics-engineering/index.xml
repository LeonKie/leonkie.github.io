    <description><![CDATA[What is a Flipdot Display ? A flipdot display is a fascinating example of electromechanical display technology, often found on old buses as destination signs. These displays are valued for their retro aesthetics and functional reliability. Each dot in the display is a magnetic disc with one coloured side and one black side. The disc is flipped using an electromagnetic coil which holds the disc in place by magnetic polarisation.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In the realm of biomedical engineering, my Master&rsquo;s thesis at the Technical University of Munich&rsquo;s Institute of Micro Technology and Medical Device Technology (MiMed) introduces a novel approach to shoulder rehabilitation through the development of the Actuated Scissor Shoulder Mechanism Exoskeleton (ASSM-EXO). This project contributtes to the development in the field of mobile exoskeletions, focusing on the design and evaluation of a compact, wearable device intended to aid in the recovery of individuals experiencing shoulder mobility impairments, particularly following stroke-related hemiparesis.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction to the Cybathlon Prosthesis In the course of 2 Semesters, we, in a team of 3 people, designed and prototyped a robotic hand for the Cybathlon competition, aiming to realise an anthropomorphic prosthetic hand. The project was guided by the principle of anthropomorphism in robotics, focusing on emulating the appearance, motion, and sensory capabilities of the human hand. This approach led us to develop a prosthesis that not only met the functional requirements of the competition but also had a visually appealing, human-like design.]]></description>
