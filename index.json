[{"categories":["Robotics","Prosthesis Development"],"content":"Introduction to the Cybathlon Prosthesis In the course of 2 Semesters, we, in a team of 3 people, designed and prototyped a robotic hand for the Cybathlon competition, aiming to realise an anthropomorphic prosthetic hand. The project was guided by the principle of anthropomorphism in robotics, focusing on emulating the appearance, motion, and sensory capabilities of the human hand. This approach led us to develop a prosthesis that not only met the functional requirements of the competition but also had a visually appealing, human-like design.

Here you can see the final prototype including key design highlights in the build. In total, the prosthesis had a weight of 0.9kg which is comparable to state of the art prostheses. The prosthesis design process involved substantial research and creative engineering to achieve the desired functionality and aesthetics. We focused on developing a gripping mechanism with a singular degree of freedom (DOF) but capable of performing both power and pinch grasp which are essential for the Cybathlon competition. Additionally, our wrist mechanism featured two DOFs, providing enhanced agility and functionality in grasping motions.

The thumb, with its unique design, was integral to achieving effective grasping modes.

To add torsional stiffness to the joint additonal cruciat ligaments where used similar to the ones present in a human knee joint.

It housed the motor unit, finger mounts, and the pulley system essential for the tendon-driven movement of the fingers. The challenge was to integrate these mechanical elements within a design that mimicked the human palm‚Äôs look and feel. By using lightweight materials like Nylon and PLA, we managed to balance mechanical functionality with an anthropomorphic appearance. On the figure above you can see the tendon routing which enables two different adaptive grasping types. One where the thumb is delayed and therefore curls over the index finger (power grasp) and one where the timing of the fingers is tuned such that index finger and thumb meet directly (pinch grasp).

Instead of assigning one motor for each DOF, we developed a differential wrist mechanism that connected both motors in the same power train. Flexion and extension can be achieved by rotating both motors in the same directions. Pronation and Supination is realized if the motors are actuated in opposing directions. This design allowed for simultaneous and continuous power allocation to both DOFs of the wrist. The motors, placed close to the stump interface, optimised weight distribution and reduced structural stress.

Manual Locking Mechanism for Supination and Pronation A notable feature is the additional manual degree of freedom for the wrist. This improvement allows for heightened control and flexibility, enabling users to navigate their prosthetics with greater precision. In total, it introduces a 14-step rotation system with 25.7¬∞ increments. A robust, tight locking mechanism is integrated to prevent unintended movements.

For non-linear plants like our inverted pendulum, the system equations first have to be linearized about the upright (unstable) equilibrium. This consequently means that our LQR controller is only sufficient within small deviations around the upright position. After linearizing we have to calculate the gains $K$, this is done using the script linked here. With all that done, we now can compute the input voltage of the Motor using the following equation: $$ u = -Kx $$ A deeper dive into the theory behind the calculation of the linearized model can be found here!
