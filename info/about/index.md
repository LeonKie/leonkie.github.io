 *Hi I am Leon Kiesgen.*
{{</typeit>}}

**Mechanical engineer and maker**. I love to come up with unique solutions for unknown problems and this is the right space for my personal projects that what to be noticed :).

{{<admonition type="note" title="What is this Blog about?">}}

I have done several projects in the past involving *arduinos*, *mechatronics* or simple *mechanical designs* mostly around *3d printing*.
However, in the future, I also want to share some more *software orientated* projects and creative stuff that comes into my mind.

So stay tuned!!
