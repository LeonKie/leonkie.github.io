*Hi I am Leon Kiesgen.*
{{</typeit>}}

As a **robotic engineer** and enthusiast for DIY projects, I thrive on devising innovative solutions to novel challenges. This platform serves as a showcase some of my **personal** and **research** related endeavors.

{{<admonition type="note" title="What is this Blog about?">}}

I have done several projects in the past involving *arduinos*, *mechatronics* or simple *mechanical designs* mostly around *3d printing*.
However, in the future, I also want to share some more *software orientated* projects and creative stuff that comes into my mind.

So stay tuned!!
